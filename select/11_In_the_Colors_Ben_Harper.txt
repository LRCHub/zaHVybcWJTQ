When your whole world is shaken
From all the risks we have taken
Dance with me, dance with me
Into the colors of the dusk

When you have awoken
From all the dreams broken
Come and dance with me, dance with me
Into the colors of the dusk
Dance with me in the colors of the dusk

The paths we're walking on, they crumble behind us
But if we leave now, they will never, they will never find us
And if this crazy world spins itself down to dust
I wanna be with you, I'm gonna be with you in the colors

When you again start hoping
With your arms wide open
Come on, dance with me, oh, dance with me
Into the colors of the dusk

And all will be right, will be right
Dancing like water with the light
Oh, dance with me, won't you dance with me
Into the colors of the dusk?

Oh, dance with me into the colors of the dusk
Dance with me to the colors of the dusk
