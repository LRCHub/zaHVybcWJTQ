Back through the years I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags someone gave us
And how my mamma put those rags to use

There were rags of many colours, every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat, it was way down in the fall
Mamma sewed the rags together, she sewed ever piece with love
She made my coat of many colours, I was so proud of

As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many colours Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it as mamma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colours that mamma made for me
Made from only rags, but I wore it so proudly
Although we didn't have much money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

So with patches on breaches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colours, well, I started home to school
Just to find the children laughing, makin' fun of me
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me

Now, I didn't understand it, for I felt as I was rich
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch
I told about the story, mamma told me while she sewed
And my coat of many colours was worth more than all their clothes

They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be
Although we didn't have much money, I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made for me
In my coat of many colours, my mamma made just for me
